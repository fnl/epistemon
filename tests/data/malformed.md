# Malformed Markdown Test

This file has some unusual content that tests markdown handling.

<<< Invalid HTML tags >>>
[Unclosed link(http://example.com
**Unclosed bold
*Unclosed italic

```
Unclosed code block

# Multiple # Headers ### On ## One ### Line

Mixed formatting **bold *italic** still italic*

This is fine though - markdown is forgiving!
