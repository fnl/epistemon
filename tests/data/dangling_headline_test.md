# Main Title

This is the first paragraph that provides some context about the document. It needs to be long enough to take up a reasonable amount of space in a chunk.

## First Section

This is content under the first section. This paragraph should be substantial enough that when combined with the heading and the previous content, we approach the chunk size limit. We want to ensure that the chunker handles this properly.

## Second Section

This is content under the second section that should not be separated from its headline. The headline and this paragraph belong together semantically.
