# Sample Document

This is a sample markdown document for testing the semantic search functionality.

## Introduction

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides tools for document loading, text splitting, embeddings, and vector stores.

## Key Concepts

### Document Loaders

Document loaders help you load documents from various sources including markdown files, PDFs, and web pages.

### Text Splitters

Text splitters break down large documents into smaller chunks that can be processed more efficiently. The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is commonly used for this purpose.

### Embeddings

Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning. Popular embedding models include OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small and HuggingFace's all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

### Vector Stores

Vector stores enable efficient similarity search over embedded documents. Chroma is a popular choice for persistent storage.

## Conclusion

By combining these components, you can build powerful semantic search applications that understand the meaning of queries rather than just matching keywords.
